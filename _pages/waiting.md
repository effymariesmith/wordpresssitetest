<h2 class="entry-title">Pipelines</h2>
<p>    This page gives an idea of the Data Arena pipelines and how we use them to easily create data visualizations.</p>
<h4>What is a pipeline?</h4>
<p>A pipeline is a semi-automated workflow to build a visualization for a category of data.<br>
There are restrictions for the input data of each pipeline and a defined type of visualization as output.<br>
Some parameters, such as coloring and size of the visualization can be changed.</p>
<h4>What pipelines are available?</h4>
<p>Currently, we provide the piplines in the <a href="/pages/quickstart.html">Quickstart</a>.</p>
<h4>How do I use a pipeline?</h4>
<p>If your data is compliant with one of the pipelines, you can use one of the examples in <code>/local/examples</code>.<br>
Copy the <code>LoadX.py</code> and adjust the parameters and start the visualization with <code>orun LoadYOURDATA.py</code>.</p>
<h4>How can I share my pipeline changes?</h4>
<p>In order to create more pipelines for different data or visualizations, we encourage you to contribute your results to our public <a href="https://github.com/UTSDataArena">repository</a>.</p>

<h3>What is Houdini?</h3>

Houdini is ideal for modelers, lighters, character riggers and animators to use on its own or as a layout and lighting tool for visual effects created in Houdini FX.</p>
<h4>Why does it help in data visualization?</h4>
<p>A few of our <a href="/pages/pipelines.html">Pipelines</a>. at the Data Arena are created using Houdini, Houdini is a powerful tool to create data visualizations.</p>
