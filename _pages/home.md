<h3 class="widget-title">About</h3>
This is the UTS Data Arena Virtual Machine documentation, read the User Guide to learn more about the project.

Or get started below, by having a look at some <a>demos</a> or use one of our existing pipelines explained in <a href=" /wordpress/quick-start/"> Quickstart</a> to visualize your data.

If your data does not fit into an existing Pipeline, read more about it and create your own based on our framework. More information about the backend is provided in Software.

You are welcome to share your work(link to git hub), that we can build more pipelines and make data visualization easier.

Once you have set up your visualization using one of our pipelines or by creating your own, visit The UTS Data Arena to explore your data.

<h3 class="widget-title">THE DATA ARENA</h3>
The UTS Data Arena is a 360-degree interactive data visualisation facility set to change the way we view and interact with data.

Viewers stand in the middle of a large cylindrical screen, four metres high and ten metres in diameter. A high performance computer graphics system drives six 3D-stereo video projectors, edge-blended to create a seamless three-dimensional panorama.

Picture clarity is made possible from an image that’s 20,000 x 1200 pixels. Each user wears Active-Shutter Glasses, which present separate left/right views to achieve a stereo-visual effect. To complement the visual experience, a 16-channel audio system surrounds the Arena. Speakers fitted behind the perforated screen allow sound to be positioned in 3D space.

It’s a powerful immersive facility which can help business, government, and research simplify complex information. Users in the Arena can surround themselves in data to observe, explore, refine, improve, discover and learn.
