<h3 class="widget-title">About</h3>			<h6>
<p>This is the UTS Data Arena Virtual Machine documentation, read the User Guide to learn more about the project.</p>
<p>Or get started below, by having a look at some  <a href=" http://localhost:8002/">demos</a>  or use one of our existing pipelines explained in <a href=" http://https://localhost/wordpress/quick-start/"> Quickstart</a> to visualize your data.</p>
<p> If your data does not fit into an existing Pipeline, read more about it and create your own based on our framework. More information about the backend is provided in Software. </p>
<p>You are welcome to share your work(link to git hub), that we can build more pipelines and make data visualization easier.</p>
<p>Once you have set up your visualization using one of our pipelines or by creating your own, visit The UTS Data Arena to explore your data.<br>

<h3 class="widget-title">THE DATA ARENA</h3>			<p>The UTS Data Arena is a 360-degree interactive data visualisation facility set to change the way we view and interact with data.</p>
<p>Viewers stand in the middle of a large cylindrical screen, four metres high and ten metres in diameter. A high performance computer graphics system drives six 3D-stereo video projectors, edge-blended to create a seamless three-dimensional panorama.</p>
<p>Picture clarity is made possible from an image that’s 20,000 x 1200 pixels. Each user wears Active-Shutter Glasses, which present separate left/right views to achieve a stereo-visual effect. To complement the visual experience, a 16-channel audio system surrounds the Arena. Speakers fitted behind the perforated screen allow sound to be positioned in 3D space.</p>
<p>It’s a powerful immersive facility which can help business, government, and research simplify complex information. Users in the Arena can surround themselves in data to observe, explore, refine, improve, discover and learn.</p>
