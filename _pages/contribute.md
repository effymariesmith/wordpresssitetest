<strong>Edit the Parent </strong>

Change the Parent to the name of the section you would like to contribute too. For example, if you would like to add a page to the User Guide, change the parent to User Guide. This will make the User Guide section the Parent to your page and ensure it will be adding to the menu inside the page template.

<strong>Edit the Template</strong>

Change the Template to the name of the section you would like to contribute too. For example, if you would like to add a page to the User Guide, change the Template to User Guide. This will make sure you are using the correct page template for the page you wish to add.

<strong>Edit the Order</strong>

Change the order number to change where your page will display within the navigation system. We are currently using increments of 10 for our page numbering system.

The first page to display is set to 1, the next set to 1o, the next 20 and so on. If you want your page to display between page 1 and page 2 set your page number to 5. If you want to add your page to the end of the list, count how many pages are already created, for example, if there are 10 pages already created, then make your page 110.
