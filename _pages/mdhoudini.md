## What is Houdini?

[Houdini](http://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/) combines superior performance and dramatic, ease-of-use to deliver a powerful and accessible 3D animation experience to CG artists creating feature films, 
commercials or video games. With its procedural node-based workflow, Houdini lets you create more content faster to reduce timelines and enjoy enhanced flexibility in all your creative tasks.
Houdini is ideal for modelers, lighters, character riggers and animators to use on its own or as a layout and lighting tool for visual effects created in Houdini FX.
